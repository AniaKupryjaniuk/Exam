        <h3>Goal:</h3>
        <p>Creating a responsive website.</p>

        <h3>Process:</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the Basic Web theme, I had to do research and collect relevant content about the deconstructivism style. I had to create multi-device wireframes, choose a typography style and create a style tile for the design of the website. Later I was developing a prototype on Adobe XD and improving my first website's design choices-changing colour scheme for more contrasting. Then I tested the prototype website with a "trunk-test” and implemented another changes and improvements for the website’s colors, navigation, and layout. All this process was documented on a pdf file. To end this assignment, I worked on developing my responsive website with basic coding knowledge by applying the design changes that were prototyped and tested before. </p>

        <h3>Gains:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning how to sketch wireframes - the main tool for planning the layout of website;</li>
            <li>Creating style tile - a guide that makes the design process easier;</li>
            <li>Learning basic design principles (gestalt principles) and applying them in practice to achieve the desired result;</li>
            <li>Use of Adobe XD prototyping and user testing (trunk-test);</li>
            <li>Using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Using CSS grids and implementing breakpoints for the main layout to make the website responsive;</li>
            <li>Writing semantically correct code and validating code.</li>
        </ul>
